# videoipod

A new Flutter project.

## About

I am building this app to practice Flutter, Agora, and Riverpod. This is an iPod themed video player that will display video calls in the iPod display and other video features down the road. The buttons and the wheel function depending on the widget in the display. Riverpod manages the active display, button controls, and other state needs.
